# Adaptive Book Hygiene POC - Project Analysis Complete

## Project Discovery

Despite the folder name suggesting a reading application, this is actually a **Financial SaaS Platform** that evaluates the health of business accounting records ("books") for QuickBooks users.

## Tech Stack Overview

**Frontend Framework:**
- [`React 19.1.1`](package.json) with [`TypeScript 5.9.2`](package.json) for modern UI development
- [`Vite 7.0.6`](vite.config.ts) as build tool (replacing Create React App)
- [`Tailwind CSS 3.4.0`](tailwind.config.js) for utility-first styling

**Backend Services:**
- [`Clerk 5.38.1`](package.json) for complete authentication solution
- [`Supabase 2.53.0`](package.json) for database and backend services  
- [`Svix 1.70.0`](package.json) for webhook management

**Development Tools:**
- React Testing Library suite for testing
- PostCSS + Autoprefixer for CSS processing
- TypeScript strict mode configuration

## Application Architecture

**Three-Component Workflow:**
1. [`LandingPage.tsx`](src/components/LandingPage.tsx) - Marketing site with Clerk authentication
2. [`AgentForm.tsx`](src/components/AgentForm.tsx) - Business information collection with validation
