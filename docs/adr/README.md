# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural decisions made throughout the project's development.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help future developers understand why certain decisions were made.

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?]

## Consequences

### Positive
[What becomes easier or better?]

### Negative
[What becomes harder or worse?]

## Implementation Notes
[Technical details, code examples, migration steps]
```
